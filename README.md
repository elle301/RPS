Javascript Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is my first Javascript project. It was created alongside a FreeCodeCamp Tutorial. I'm very proud of how it came out. It was really interesting to use the ES6 syntax that I've learned. It was especially fun pausing the video and trying to sort the functions out on my own before hearing the teacher's explanation. 

I can't wait to make more and increaingly complex material.
